      I celebrate the birthday of a genius, the best of its kind. You are a
      treasure to humanity. Sometimes, I wonder what I have done to deserve such
      a considerate friend as you are sir. I will be here to celebrate your next
      birthday and the one after it because you are a friend worth being with at
      all times. On this awesome day of your life, I wish you the fantastic
      things you want for yourself. When I look at the brighter side of my life,
      you have contributed so much to it.
